In this project, the goal is to design a bot-trader that uses historical option market data of S&P 500 index
to forward test the performance of trading short-term calendar spreads on the call side, on the put side,
or on both sides. The expiry date(s) of the calendar’s short leg can be chosen from 0,1, 2, etc. days, while
of that of the calendar’s long leg can be from 1,2,3, etc. days. The bot-trader will produce different
performance metrics such as positive expectancy, Sharpe Ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, average
and maximum values of losses and wins. It will also produce a spreadsheet of all simulated trades.

The students will have or gain the following skills and knowledge:
- Good programming skills in MATLAB.
- Good skills in creating and updating spreadsheets in MATLAB.
- Good skills dealing and accessing with huge amount of data.

Having good knowledge of financial markets and derivative markets is a plus but it can be acquired during the course of the project. The students will work with real-time date through accessing the API of the broker platform. The end goal of this project is to use the bot-trader to forward-test a buying calendar spread strategy developed by the supervisor and fine-tune the trading input/output parameters, including the average profit/loss dollar per trade, maximum drawdown, CGAR, premium capture rate, etc.
NOTE: Students from disciplines other than Electrical and Software Engineering programs are welcome to apply.
